# How we measure thinking tools

**The dimensions used to characterise thinking tools in the spidergraph on the [home page](README) need to find a balance between usability and granularity.**

This is unlikely to be an easy balance to find, as:

* the people *contributin*g this data know the tools well (and so will generally prefer granularity). 
* but *this map is aimed at newcomers*, for whom usability is more important as they try and find their way through this landscape.

## Phase 1

In Phase 1 of this project:

* we are happy to discuss and improve the following dimensions while the code is being developed for version 2 - see [[Project plan]] and [[How to comment]]
* we've tried to find a balance and keep the number of dimensions to a dozen or less. 

Note: in addition to the dimensions in the following table, Personal profiles includes a place to put your **Confidence** with the tool. We haven't figured out if and how we'll factor this in, but it looks like a good idea.

All scores (including Confidence) are ona 1-10 scale (terrible - brilliant):

| **Axis**           | **Definition**                                                                    | **To score highly**                                                                                                                          |
