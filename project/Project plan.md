# Project plan 

## Phase 0: define, create mockup

### At a glance: Peter, Bill & Mathew knock the basic idea around until it's ready for p1

* Create a first set of scoring dimensions, which will mean aligning various tables developed by various people 
	* martyr draft (ML) - done
	* transferred to airtable draft (all) - done
	* to [[How we measure thinking tools]] for comments in p1
* Get ML up to speed on Massive Wiki (herculanean team effort)
* site mockup (ML): no actual code, but shows how it will look  
	* first draft site structure 
	* first draft content types (personal profiles, tools, practices, etc) & ancillary pages

### ToDo:
* vision statement (all)
* rewrite prototype content according to this plan (ML)
* create spidergraph mockup p0, add to home page (ML) - done
* Get Documentation to p1-ready state, including
	* basic Massive Wiki documentation
	* [[How to contribute]] - to check
	* [[How to comment]] - to check


## Phase 1:  FoTL/OGM early adopters

### Two activities in parallel:

* Open our discussion about the scoring dimensions to early adopters from FoTL/OGM community and try to get a consensus (see [[How we measure thinking tools]]) 
* get the basic code working and test it
* all early adopters provide personal profiles and contribute content to Tool and Practice pages 

When these two activities converge we will have Phase 2.

### ToDo

* achieve consensus on dimensions 
* The site actually works somewhat:
	* tool and practice files auto-populated with excerpts from personal profiles
	* data from personal profiles added to datastore
	* spidergraph auto-updated from datastore (ideally)
	* homepage features spidergraph - see [[homepage spidergraph proposal]] (but probably without user input form)
	* [[404 page process]] 
		* "A better 404 page" - already done
		* Automated template-driven page creation - if possible, otherwise for a later version
	* create a project tracker
* test above using content from participants 
	* people profiles by all participants, using agreed dimensions, with support if needed
	* necessary tool and practice files edited
* refine site and documentation in light of experience and feedback, creating v2 of both. (understandable by friends of friends)

## Phase 2:  Friends of friends

* Widen the circle of invitees to other people we know interested in the field
* assess interest, support submitters, refine site, system & documentation

We might do this several times before the site is ready for...

## Phase 3: Full launch
The site is promoted by all contributors.

Details TBD.

### Optional: 
*This may be outside project scope, could come later.* 

Add a system allowing non Obsidian / GitHub users to 
* submit their profile
* add tools and technique files
* provide scores

## Plan the next project

We should have plenty of ideas...
